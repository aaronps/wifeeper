# Wifeeper - The Wifi Keeper

This mini tool for Android will keep you CPU and Wifi powered on always. This is
usefull when you are developing with `adb` over **tcp** because the phone will
go to sleep and you will need to wake it up manually.

Using **Wifeeper** should help to reduce the number of times you have to take
the phone with your hands.
